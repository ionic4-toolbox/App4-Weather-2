# Ionic Weather Labs

This application is used as the basis for the following sets of labs:

* Ionic Pro Setup
* Automated Testing

## Branches

* master - the baseline application
* pro - Ionic Pro integration labs
* testing - automated testing labs
* complete - all of the lab supportng branches merged together

## Labs

The various lab topics are independent of one another so they can be taught in any order. The all use this as
the baseline, while in class you could actually build one lab upon another with (perhaps) some minor coding
modifications.
