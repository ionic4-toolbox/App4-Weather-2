# Ionic Weather Demo

This application is the basis for a demo that I am doing for [ThatConference](https://www.thatconference.com) on using Custom Elements (or Web Components) to increase code reuse across projects that are written using various modern frameworks.

The master branch of this application uses plain old Angular coding contructs to display the current weather conditions. The `feature/useComponents` branch introduces the use of Custom Elements to perform the same function. This reduces the amount of code and increases the code reuse since those Custom Elements can easily be used in any other project that needs to display the current weather conditions.
